# GraphicalMailMergeForTheWebOnStickers (formerly LabelZ)

So you want to give something/somebody a custom sticker, nametag, whatever.
Any webcontent based on the specific parameters can be used (e.g. personal driving directions)
Sizes, shapes, colors, patterns, margins of the pieces and overall sheet can be set and dealt with, into ready-to-print PDFs
